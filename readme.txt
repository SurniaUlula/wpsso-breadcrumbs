WPSSO Core extension to add JSON-LD formatted Schema BreadcrumbList markup for Google / SEO.

== Description ==

**Add breadcrumbs markup to posts, pages, and custom post types.**

**Select between using ancestors (parents, grand-parents, etc.) or categories.**

**No need to use any PHP code, functions, or modify any templates:**

Simply activate / deactivate the WPSSO Breadcrumbs Markup plugin to enable / disable the addition of Schema BreadcrumbList markup in your webpages.

**WPSSO Breadcrumbs is *incredibly fast* and coded for performance:**

WPSSO Core and its extensions make full use of all available caching techniques (persistent / non-persistent object and disk caching), and load only the PHP library files and object classes they need, keeping their code small, fast, and light.

WPSSO Core and its extensions are fully tested and compatible with PHP v7.x (PHP v5.4 or better required).

**New Extension for the WPSSO Core Plugin:**

WPSSO Breadcrumbs Markup (aka WPSSO BC) is the newest extension for the WPSSO Core plugin. You can expect many more features in future versions, including breadcrumbs markup for archive type pages (dates, tags, categories, and custom terms / taxonomies).
